**1. Business Understanding**

**Objective**
The objective of this analysis is to explore the Iris dataset, visualize relationships between different features, and understand how these features can help in distinguishing between the three species of iris flowers.

2. **Data Understanding**
   
**Data Collection**
- The dataset was collected from the Seaborn library, which provides a built-in version of the Iris dataset. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with the following attributes:

- **sepal_length:** Length of the sepal (in cm)

- **sepal_width:** Width of the sepal (in cm)

- **petal_length:** Length of the petal (in cm)

- **petal_width:** Width of the petal (in cm)

- **species:** The species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

**Initial Exploration**

- The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns.
  
- There are no missing values in any of the columns.
  
3. **Data Preparation**
   
**Data Cleaning**

- Verified that there are no null values or duplicates in the dataset.
  
- The data types for each column were confirmed to be appropriate (e.g., numerical types for length and width).
  
**Feature Selection**

- All features were retained for analysis as they contribute to distinguishing the species.

4. **Data Modeling**
   
**Visualization**

- **Scatter Plot 1:** Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width

**Observations**: Setosa species is clearly separable from the other two species.

- **Scatter Plot 2**: Petal Length vs. Petal Width

**Observations:** Strong correlation observed; Setosa is again easily distinguishable, while Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap.

**5. Evaluation**

**Insights** 

**The analysis revealed that:**

- Setosa can be perfectly identified based on sepal and petal measurements.
 
- Versicolor and Virginica are more challenging to distinguish based solely on the sepal dimensions but can be differentiated using petal dimensions.

**6. Deployment**

**Reporting**

- The findings from this analysis can be used to inform further classification modeling efforts, potentially utilizing machine learning algorithms to enhance species classification accuracy.

**7. Maintenance**

**Future Considerations**

- Explore additional features or datasets that might improve classification results.
  
- Consider deploying models that can predict species based on user input of sepal and petal dimensions.
